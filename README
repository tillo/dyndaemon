dyndaemon v1.0

dyndaemon is a little piece of software I wrote to reconfigure and restart
daemons when the external IP changes.

Config file "dyndaemon.conf" must be in /etc, /usr/local/etc or in the same directory of
"dyndaemon.pl". See "dyndaemon.conf.example" for help on configuring dyndaemon.

Arguments are:

	-i IF	It makes dyndaemon look for the first v4 address of IF instead of ppp0
	-n	It makes dyndaemon not to write to files nor execute commands
	-d NUM	It makes dyndaemon output debug messages. NUM can be 1, 2 or 3

Enjoy
