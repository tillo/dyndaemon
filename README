dyndaemon

dyndaemon is a little piece of software I wrote to reconfigure and restart
daemons when the external IP changes.

It should be runned from command line or by cron/schedule.

It takes the actual IP address from the external interface and checks,
following his config file, that a list of daemons' config files are
correctly configured with that address to listen to.
If the address is not the good one, it changes it and restarts every daemon.

It is really useful when a system has multiple interfaces and a list of
daemons have to listen to one DHCP-configured interface; the other
interfaces will be used by jails/virtual machines/other daemons.

Config file "dyndaemon.conf" must be in /etc, /usr/local/etc or in the same directory of
"dyndaemon.pl". See "dyndaemon.conf.example" for help on configuring dyndaemon.

Arguments are:

	-i, --iface IF		It makes dyndaemon look for the first v4 address of interface IF instead of ppp0
	-n, --donothing		It makes dyndaemon not to write to files nor execute commands
	-d, --debug NUM		It makes dyndaemon output debug messages. NUM can be 1, 2 or 3
	-h, --help		It makes dyndaemon output a little help message about arguments

Enjoy
